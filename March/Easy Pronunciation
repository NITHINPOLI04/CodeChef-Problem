# Problem: Easy Pronunciation (https://www.codechef.com/practice/course/1-star-difficulty-problems/DIFF1200/problems/EZSPEAK)
# Author: P. Nithin

"""
Problem Statement:
You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. A word is considered hard to pronounce if it contains four or more consecutive consonants; otherwise, it is easy to pronounce.

Our task is to determine whether the given word is easy to pronounce (YES) or hard to pronounce (NO).
"""

Approach:
"""
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer `n` (length of the string).
   - Read the string `s`.
   - Iterate through each character:
     - Reset count if it's a vowel.
     - Increment count if it's a consonant.
     - If count reaches 4, print "NO" and stop.
   - If loop completes, print "YES".
"""

Complexity Analysis:
"""
- Time Complexity: O(n) per test case (single pass through string)
- Space Complexity: O(1) (constant extra space)
"""

Code Implementation:
def solve():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}  # Set of vowels

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Length of string
        s = input()  # Input string
        count = 0  # Consecutive consonant counter

        for char in s:
            if char in vowels:
                count = 0  # Reset count on vowel
            else:
                count += 1  # Increment on consonant
            
            if count == 4:  # Condition to break
                print("NO")
                break
        else:
            print("YES")  # If loop completes without break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
